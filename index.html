Dungeons and Dragons can give you access to other worlds, but where to start, well you need a character, so here is my summary of all main classes in D&D!<br><br>

                
The Barbarian:
If you love movies like die hard, or just want to smash everything thing in sight the barbarian is for you. The barbarian boasts incredibly strength and high health, at the expensive of intelligence, charisma and generally interacting with human when not wielding an axe.<br><br>
The Bard:
If you are looking for a base character that will help your teammates in any situation, bard is the perfect role for you. Bards are a jack of all trades character, and are always helpful particularly because of their high dexterity and charisma, bards also have a special ability called “inspire” that allows you to increase the chance of a success outcome of a teammate.<br><br>
Cleric:
Clerics are one of the many classes that relies upon divine magic, clerics are sometimes considered as “the healer” however clerics are extremely powerful even at low levels, they also benefit from high wisdom and charisma additionally they can cast spells.<br><br>

Druid:
The green thumb, but don’t think that nature doesn’t have a druids back, not only can they perform spells and magic they can also TRANSFORM into an animal, druids also have animal sidekicks kind of like in Pokémon, but with more pain.<br><br>
Fighter:
So, you want to charge into fights like an idiot, and return victorious with your victims “taking a long nap” then fighter is the perfect class for you. Unlike barbarians fighters are more of a here for a fun time not a long time, whereas barbarians can sustain dozens of hits.<br><br>
Monk:
So you think just because they took a vow of silence they won’t punch you so fast their hand sets on fire, HA WRONG, never underestimate a monk, they use there ki powers (similar to magic), their great speed and strength to destroy any advisory. They also benefit from boosted dexterity and wisdom.<br><br>
Paladin:
Paladins fight for a cause and are mainly related to a fighter class with some magical powers added. Paladins mainly have a martial arts background, however their martial art abilities are no match for the magical powers that they wield, they also have great dexterity, strength or constitution.<br><br>
Ranger:
A common role for newbies, rangers are trained hunters, who also exhibit intelligence unlike many other fighter type classes. Rangers can also cast spells with power from nature, Rangers benefit from naturally high Dexterity and Wisdom, basic equipment includes a short sword or two melee weapons, and a long bow with 20 arrows.<br><br>
Rouge:
So, you play a lot of Assassins Creed, or maybe you just want to be Ethan Hunt, Rouges have many skills and are particularly known for their deception and stealthiest, however rouges can also learn spells and are complemented by their Dexterity boost, for their quick fingers.<br><br>

Sorcerer:
You watch a lot of harry potter don’t you, sorcerers are wizards that have fused magic with their body and soul, allowing for unmatched powers, however sorceress do not rely upon spell books or lore they instead use the magic inside of there bloodline, sorcerers are also given a charisma boost, to help them get out of some sticky situations.<br><br>

Warlock:
Warlocks are like clerics, however warlocks can be directed by any ancient power, not just gods, warlocks seek to learn more about magic, and grow in power. And in return they preform services for there chosen ancient power. Warlocks unlike most other magic focused classes also have proficiency in hand to hand combat and are also given a boost in charisma.<br><br>
